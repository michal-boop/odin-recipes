    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This really is the <strong>Best Ever Vegan Brownies Recipe!</strong> Fudgy, gooey, perfect squares of chocolate that cut easily and are easy to make. You'll never buy a boxed brownie mix again!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons ground flax</li>
        <li>/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegan butter (earth balance brand), melted *see instructions</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, lightly packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup non-dairy chocolate chips OR roughly chopped chocolate pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the flax eggs by stirring the ground flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside to thicken. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 7 x 11 pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Melt the vegan butter (earth balance brand preferred), and measure 1/2 cup. I do this by microwaving the vegan butter in a glass measuring cup, in 30 second intervals, until melted.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the melted vegan butter and sugars together. Add the flax eggs and vanilla, whisk until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Over the same large bowl, sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Add the salt and baking powder and stir with a large wooden spoon until just combined, do not over mix. </li>
        <li>Fold in half of the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top with a spoon or your hands. Sprinkle the rest of the chocolate chips on top of the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes. The brownies may still be bubbling and not look done, but they will firm up a lot as they cool.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then pull the brownies out, using the parchment paper and let cool for another 15-30 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
